# Caffeine-Consumption
For our project we looked at caffeine consumption and its relationship to productivity. 
The following are the data sets that we used:
* ANHRS_08112022231653052.csv (Hours Worked Datasaet)
* Productivity.csv
* coffee.csv
* energy_drinks.csv

Our final project consists of 3 Notebooks:

* Full_Data: File for combination and merging of all four data sets. Used for prediction portion of project
* Full_Data2: File for combination and creation of maps (visualizations)
* Final_Project_Submission-2: The notebook which includes all sections of project
  * Motivation
  * Methdology
  * Research Questions
  * General Background 
  * Correlation Plots
  * Test and Train Data
  * Prediction Class
  * Predictions
  * Results
  * Limitations
  
* Note: The full data cleaning was performed in Full_Data and Full_Data2 files. We used a store function in both notebooks, so these can be easily accessed via the final_submission_file.
